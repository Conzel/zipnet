                        <h1>Zipnet - a neural image codec entirely in your browser!</h1>
                        <p>Try it out with your own image. A trained neural network will find an efficient encoding for
                            your
                            image and you can then download it.
                            The encoding will be lossy (similar to JPEG - but it often looks more natural to the eye).
                            You
                            can then re-upload the encoded image to see the reconstruction.
                            And the best thing about it – this algorithm runs entirely in your browser. No servers or
                            anything involved!

                    <h2>What is a neural image codec?</h2>
                    <p>A codec is a short word for an algorithm which encodes or decodes data.
                        The vast majority of the internet traffic is carried in the form of
                        images and videos, which are largely compressed using classical, lossy codecs (JPEG, MPEG...).
                        These have been hand-crafted to ensure a good compression performance (the compressed data is
                        small) and a low distortion (the image still looks similar to the original after
                        decompression).
                        In the past years, Machine Learning has popped up in all kinds of
                        different places, and compression algorithms have been a very recent field of
                        inquiry. In contrast to the manual classical codec, a neural codec uses a neural network to
                        learn how to best compress the data while keeping a low distortion.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why is this interesting?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, the majority of the internet traffic is encoded image and video data.
                        <!-- Add the papers -->
                        Recent research has shown that neural codecs have the potential to greatly increase compression
                        performance and while even producing more natural looking reconstructions (no more JPEG
                        artifacts!).
                        A greater compression performance means reduced data size. This results in reduced network
                        traffic and can thus save a lot of costs in hardware, reduce energy usage and increase network
                        performance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What does Zipnet add to this?</h2>
                    <p> One of the biggest drawbacks of current neural codecs is their computational cost.
                        The focus of Machine Learning research often lies on the performance
                        on certain benchmarks. For this, the networks often get very big and are required to run
                        on expensive hardware, like GPUs costing upwards of 1000€. Thus, most Machine Learning services
                        that can be used by someone over a website are powered via large servers.
                        <!-- Example of such a site. -->
                        This is not feasible for compression algorithms, as a server obviously cannot do the decoding
                        job
                        for an end user. Zipnet aims to bridge this gap between research and application.
                        We provide neural codec that can run in any web browser on any reasonably modern hardware
                        in an acceptable time.

                    <p>
                        The following are some more technical informations about the project.
                        If you are further interested, make sure to check out our <a
                            href="https://github.com/Conzel/zipnet"> <i class="fab fa-github"></i><span>Github

                    </p>
                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>
                    We built an architecture that closely matches <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01704"> "End-to-End optimized image compression", 2017, Ballé et al. </a> published at ICLR. 
                    This architecture has been described in later papers as the <i>(Fully) Factorized Prior Model</i>, in contrast to the hierarchical models 
                    that have been built upon this. These achieve a better compression performance, but the Factorized Model still outperforms JPEG and uses significantly less
                    weights, which makes it faster. The model functions similar to a Variational Auto-Encoder, with a slight twist: parallel to optimizing for 
                    reconstruction performance, we also learn a probability distribution over the latent state, which can later be used with modern entropy coders to compress 
                    the latent state to a very small binary file. The full training objective is then a trade-off between the reconstruction performance and the size of the encoded image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We implemented the model architecture in Python as well as in Rust. In Python, we were able to use the 
                    by <a href="https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI">compression library by CompressAI </a>, which we always used to train the models. 
                    In Rust, no such libraries existed, thus we have rewritten all the compression components from scratch. This had to be done in pure Rust, 
                    as else we would lose the simple WASM compatibility. We have only written the forward part of the networks in Rust and then imported the weights
                    we obtained from Python. This had the nice side effect of forcing us to write an implementation that is 100% compliant with Pytorch and CompressAI, 
                    which has been shown through rigorous testing. During this, we have also publish
                    <a href=https://github.com/Conzel/convolutions-rs">a crate for convolutions in Rust: convolutions-rs"</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                    Our performance is competetive to JPEG, at least in the low bitrate regimes. We will soon put up rate-distortion curves.

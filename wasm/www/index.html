                    <h1>Zipnet - a neural image codec entirely in your browser!</h1>
                    <p>Try it out with your own image. A trained neural network will find an efficient encoding for
                        your image and you can then download it.
                        The encoding will be lossy (similar to JPEG - but it often looks more natural to the eye).
                        You can then re-upload the encoded image to see the reconstruction.
                        And the best thing about it – this algorithm runs entirely in your browser. No servers or
                        anything involved!

                        You can try it out below. If you need additional instructions or want explanations

                <h1>Additional information</h1>

                    <h2 id="detailed_usage">Detailed usage</h2>
                    <h3>Encoding</h3>
                    <p>
                        The website contains two sections. One for encoding and one for decoding.
                        Under <i>Encoding Image</i>, you can encode an image by selecting the <i>Choose File</i>
                        button.
                        A file dialog should pop up. There, you can select your image file. We only accept .png,
                        as this is the most widespread format that is not encoded in a lossy form. Due to speed
                        reasons,
                        we strongly recommend uploads of a maximum size of 256x256. You can however upload larger
                        files – proceed with caution!<br>
                        We also note that Zipnet works best with images of naturally occuring scenes (landscapes,
                        objects, faces, animals...) as opposed to artificial images (screenshots, certain kinds of
                        drawings...).
                        This is simply due to the data it was trained on. We encourage you to try different images
                        to gauge the effect!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uploading the image puts a preview of the image below the <i>Choose File</i> button.
                        This is still your original image, not the encoded one. To start the encoding process, click
                        <i>Get Encoded</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the encoding process is finished (which should take a second)
                        a file download will be prompted. The file's default name should look something
                        like &quot;zipnet-enc-&lt;timestamp&gt;.bin&quot;. You can however save it as you want.
                        Additionally, some stats about the process are displayed below the <i>Get Encoded</i>
                        button.
                        You can see the previous size and the size of the encoded representation (in bytes).
                        After the encoded size, a percentage value denotes how big the file size is in relation to
                        the
                        original image.
                        Additionally, we report the <i>bits per pixel (bpp)</i> value. This indicates how many bits
                        the encoded
                        representation takes up per pixel of the original image (completely uncompressed equals
                        24 bpp for RGB8 color images).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Decoding</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the encoded file, we can start the decoding process. For this, click the <i>Choose
                            File</i>
                        button in the decoding section. This will prompt you to upload the encoded file. After
                        choosing the file,
                        the decoding process will immediately start. Don't worry, this can take some time (around
                        10-15 seconds).
                        After the process has finished, you will see a preview of the decoded image below the
                        <i>Choose File</i>
                        button. As we apply a pretty aggressive lossy compression scheme, this will result in a loss
                        of quality compare to the original.
                        After the process has finished, you can download the decoded image with the <i>Get
                            Decoded</i> button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decoding and encoding process are of course decoupled. You can encode an image, close
                        the website,
                        and visit a day later to decode your image without problems. We do not guarantee that
                        encoded images
                        will be decodeable until the end of time – we are still actively working on improving the
                        process,
                        which can render older encoded images unrecoverable if we decide to publish a new version of
                        the website.<br>
                        There is however an advantage to encoding and decoding the image in one sitting. As we will
                        have
                        access to the original in this case, we can provide some additional statistics.
                        This will result in the decoding process showing two decoded images: Our method on the
                        left, and a JPEG image that was encoded to a very similar bitrate, to the right.
                        Keep in mind: higher bitrate means a larger encoded size.
                        This typically results in a higher quality decompressed image. Most of the time,
                        the JPEG image looks a lot worse (despite having almost the same encoded file size!).
                        We confirm this via some stats below the image:
                        additionally to the bpp for both methods, we report the <i>Peak-Signal-To-Noise-Ratio
                            (PSNR)</i>.
                        This
                        is a measure of how much the image differs from the original.

                    <h2>What is a neural image codec?</h2>
                    <p>A codec is a short word for an algorithm which encodes or decodes data.
                        The vast majority of the internet traffic is carried in the form of
                        images and videos, which are largely compressed using classical, lossy codecs (JPEG, MPEG...).
                        These have been hand-crafted to ensure a good compression performance (the compressed data is
                        small) and a low distortion (the image still looks similar to the original after
                        decompression).
                        In the past years, Machine Learning has popped up in all kinds of
                        different places, and compression algorithms have been a very recent field of
                        inquiry. In contrast to the manual classical codec, a neural codec uses a neural network to
                        learn how to best compress the data while keeping a low distortion.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why is this interesting?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, the majority of the internet traffic is encoded image and video data.
                        <!-- Add the papers -->
                        Recent research has shown that neural codecs have the potential to greatly increase compression
                        performance and while even producing more natural looking reconstructions (no more JPEG
                        artifacts!).
                        A greater compression performance means reduced data size. This results in reduced network
                        traffic and can thus save a lot of costs in hardware, reduce energy usage and increase network
                        performance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What does Zipnet add to this?</h2>
                    <p> One of the biggest drawbacks of current neural codecs is their computational cost.
                        The focus of Machine Learning research often lies on the performance
                        on certain benchmarks. For this, the networks often get very big and are required to run
                        on expensive hardware, like GPUs costing upwards of 1000€. Thus, most Machine Learning services
                        that can be used by someone over a website are powered via large servers.
                        <!-- Example of such a site. -->
                        This is not feasible for compression algorithms, as a server obviously cannot do the decoding
                        job
                        for an end user. Zipnet aims to bridge this gap between research and application.
                        We provide neural codec that can run in any web browser on any reasonably modern hardware
                        in an acceptable time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>I want to know all the details!</h2>
                    <p>
                        The following are some more technical informations about the project.
                        If you are further interested, make sure to check out our <a

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>
                        We built an architecture that closely matches <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01704">
                            "End-to-End optimized image compression", 2017, Ballé et al. </a> published at ICLR.
                        This architecture has been described in later papers as the <i>(Fully) Factorized Prior
                            Model</i>, in contrast to the hierarchical models
                        that have been built upon this. These achieve a better compression performance, but the
                        Factorized Model still outperforms JPEG and uses significantly less
                        weights, which makes it faster. The model functions similar to a Variational Auto-Encoder, with
                        a slight twist: parallel to optimizing for
                        reconstruction performance, we also learn a probability distribution over the latent state,
                        which can later be used with modern entropy coders to compress
                        the latent state to a very small binary file. The full training objective is then a trade-off
                        between the reconstruction performance and the size of the encoded image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We implemented the model architecture in Python as well as in Rust. In Python, we were able to
                        use the
                        by <a href="https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI">compression library by CompressAI
                        </a>, which we always used to train the models.
                        In Rust, no such libraries existed, thus we have rewritten all the compression components from
                        scratch. This had to be done in pure Rust,
                        as else we would lose the simple WASM compatibility. We have only written the forward part of
                        the networks in Rust and then imported the weights
                        we obtained from Python. This had the nice side effect of forcing us to write an implementation
                        that is 100% compliant with Pytorch and CompressAI,
                        which has been shown through rigorous testing. During this, we have also publish
                        <a href=https://github.com/Conzel/convolutions-rs">a crate for convolutions in Rust:
                            convolutions-rs"</a>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                    Our performance is competetive to JPEG, at least in the low bitrate regimes. We will soon put up
                    rate-distortion curves.
